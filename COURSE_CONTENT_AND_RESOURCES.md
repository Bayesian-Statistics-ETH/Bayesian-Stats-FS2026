# Resources

## Literature

Below are a list of common resources. I have bolded the ones that I think are good to learn the foundations of statistics from. 

- Practical Statistics for Astronomers, Wall, 2012 [ETH library](https://eth.swisscovery.slsp.ch/permalink/41SLSP_ETH/lshl64/alma99117170816205503). Short, with a focus on practical applications. Many of the examples and exercises are from astrophysics but are generally applicable, especially for the physical sciences, which often come a bit short in general statistics textbooks. Solutions and data sets are [available online](https://www.astro.ubc.ca/people/jvw/ASTROSTATS/pracstats_web_ed2.html).
- Statistics, data mining, and machine learning in astronomy, 2020 [ETH library](https://eth.swisscovery.ch/permalink/41SLSP_ETH/13pv5mr/alma990114457340205503). A commonly used book for astrophysics data anlaysis courses. 
- **Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial, Sivia and Skilling, 2006** [ETH library](https://eth.swisscovery.ch/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma99121186169505503&context=L&vid=41SLSP_ETH:ETH&lang=en&search_scope=DiscoveryNetwork&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=discovery_network&query=any,contains,sivia%20and%20skilling&sortby=date_d&facet=frbrgroupid,include,9047206918619755727&mode=basic&offset=0). The first 4 chapters of this are the best intro to Bayesian statistics I have found.

- Bayesian Data Analysis, Gelman et al, 2013 [ETH library](https://eth.swisscovery.slsp.ch/permalink/41SLSP_ETH/lshl64/alma99117222397805503), [Link](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/). The title says it all. This is a great *reference* but not the best to learn the basics from. We may use it for the model checking parts of the course, as those chapters are very nice. 
- **Statistical Rethinking, McElreath, 2020** [ETH library](https://eth.swisscovery.slsp.ch/permalink/41SLSP_ETH/lshl64/alma99117227648305503). A very nice introduction to Bayesian statistics. The book uses `R` and `stan` but implemtations in other languages are available. Unfortunately, not available online as a PDF.
- Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms, MacKay, 2003 [Link](http://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf). Heavy on the information theory but also covers inference methods nicely. The exercises come with solutions.
- Weighing the odds, a course in probability and statistics, Williams, 2001 [ETH library](https://eth.swisscovery.slsp.ch/permalink/41SLSP_ETH/lshl64/alma99117170967205503). A good introduction to probability theory and statistics with a high level of mathematical rigour.


## Examples of other courses

- Past years of this course [here](https://github.com/tilmantroester/bayesian_statistical_methods
). We will follow quite closely what has been done in the past.
- Vanderbilt University, Stephen Taylor [here](https://github.com/VanderbiltAstronomy/astr_8070_s25
). This course is maybe the closest to what we will be doing.
- University of Minnesota, Michael Coughlin [here](https://github.com/UMN-Big-Data-in-Astrophysics
). This has a focus on large datasets and really applying statistical methods.
- University of Oregon, Ben Farr [here](https://github.com/uo-phys/comp-phys-26
). More of a projec-based focus. We may pull some suggested project topics or datasets from here.
